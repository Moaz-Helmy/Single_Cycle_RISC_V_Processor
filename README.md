# Single-Cycle RISC_V Processor

In this project, I implemented the famous **32-bit RISCV Processor**.  It's a single-cycle microarchitecture RISC-V processor based on Harvard Architecture, which means that it has two separate memories for instruction and data. The single-cycle processor executes an entire instruction in one cycle. In other words, instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, write back, and program counter update occurs within a single clock cycle.
